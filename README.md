# Unsplash_Infinite-image-scroll
The website uses the Unsplash API to display an infinite scroll of random photos. It pulls a random group of photographs from the Unsplash API and shows them in an image container with unlimited scrolling. When the user scrolls down, the website retrieves further photographs from the API and adds them to the current ones. The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it shows how to utilise the retrieve API to connect with the Unsplash API and the Intersection Observer API to perform endless scrolling.
